# Introduction
A seat that heats up fast and stays warm, combating fatigue and relaxing you. The seat optimizes the place and temperature control according to the time after the heater activates. It reduces the time it takes until you feel warm and maintains comforting warmth for longer.
There are a lot of car seat heaters in the market and they all offer a common service: heating. But not all products give you the same level of comfort that you want. You need to look for the right one by watching out for these:

Securing strap system – how will the car seat heater be kept in place? It’s important that the heater will be kept in place by a secure strap system to avoid unnecessary movement and inconvenient reinstallation. It needs to have a strong strap system for you to enjoy its services fully.
Temperature control – does it allow you to control its temperature? This is also necessary so that you can gauge your desired temperature on cold nights. You don’t need to be uncomfortable because it’s too hot or too cold.
Compatibility – the car seat heater must also be compatible with your car. Installation is important, so the heater needs to fit well with the seat to avoid discomfort while driving and traveling.
Heated seats are powered by a heating element, a long strip of material that functions as a resistor. A resistor resists the flow of electricity. When electric current flows through it, the energy is turned into heat, which flows through the seat, warming the rider.
