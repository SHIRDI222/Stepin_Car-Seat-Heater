# Stepin_Car-Seat-Heater
# Embedded C Case Study
# Problem Statement:
activity_list

Button Sensor will check the passenger is sited or not
Temperature sensor works as :
ADC Value (Temp Sensor)	Output PWM
0-200	20% - 20 째C
210-500	40% - 25 째C
510-700	70% - 29 째C
710-1024	95% - 33 째C
Display CDD- CRO will give the temperature value by showing PWM.
Led Actuator shows the driver is sited
Heater will check the heater button is ON.
Temp to CAN shows the value of temperature gone over protocol
